# System Overview

Kampus LMS Next is a role-based, modular e-learning platform built on a JAMstack architecture. The frontend is served via Next.js (React-based) with Tailwind for styling. The backend is provided via Backend-as-a-Service (Firebase or Supabase), enabling rapid development and auto-scalable infrastructure. Hosting and deployment are managed via Vercel for seamless integration with the Next.js workflow.
