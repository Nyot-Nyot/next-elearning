### Calendar Data Model
```typescript
// Calendar event structure
CalendarEvent {
  id: string,           // assignment ID
  title: string,        // assignment title
  date: Date,          // due date
  courseName: string,   // course title
  courseId: string,     // course ID
  type: 'assignment',   // event type
  status: 'upcoming' | 'overdue' | 'submitted'
}

// Calendar filter options
CalendarFilters {
  courseIds?: string[],
  assignmentTypes?: string[],
  dateRange: { start: Date, end: Date }
}
```
