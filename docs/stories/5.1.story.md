# Story 5.1: Universal Command Bar Navigation System

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user (student, lecturer, or admin),  
**I want** to use a command bar to navigate quickly,  
**so that** I can efficiently access any feature or page without clicking through multiple menus

## Acceptance Criteria
1. User can open command bar with keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+K or Cmd+K)
2. User can search for pages, features, and actions across the entire platform
3. User sees role-specific navigation options based on their permissions
4. User can navigate to any accessible page directly from command bar
5. User can execute common actions (create course, submit assignment, etc.) from command bar
6. User sees recent pages and frequently used actions in command bar
7. User can see keyboard shortcuts for actions within command bar
8. Command bar provides fuzzy search with intelligent matching
9. User can close command bar with Escape key or clicking outside
10. Command bar works consistently across all pages and user roles
