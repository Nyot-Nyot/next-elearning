3. User sees clear offline/online status indicators throughout the application
4. User drafts are automatically synchronized when connection is restored
5. User can view previously accessed content while offline (cached content)
6. User receives notifications about sync status and any conflicts
7. User can resolve sync conflicts when multiple versions exist
8. User can manually trigger sync and see sync progress
9. User offline work is preserved across browser sessions and device restarts
10. User can configure offline settings and storage preferences
