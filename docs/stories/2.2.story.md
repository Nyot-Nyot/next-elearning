## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**Epic 1** established:
- Student authentication and dashboard at `/dashboard/student`
- Role-based access control and session management

**Story 2.1** established:
- Course and Enrollment models with proper relationships
- Student course viewing system with access control
- Course detail page routing at `/dashboard/student/courses/[id]`
- Student role verification for course access

### Material Management Architecture
- **Material Access**: Students can access and read course materials [Source: prd/07-7-epics-stories.md]
- **Material Types**: PDFs, links, markdown support [Source: prd/06-6-features-by-role.md]
- **Student Experience**: Clean and user-friendly material consumption [Source: prd/07-7-epics-stories.md]

### Database Schema Requirements
- **Material Model**: New model for course materials (title, type, content, courseId)
- **Course Model**: Existing model from Story 2.1 with materials relationship
- **Material Types**: PDF, LINK, MARKDOWN enum support
- **ORM**: Prisma for material queries and relationships [Source: architecture/04-database.md]
- **Database**: NeonDB PostgreSQL for material storage [Source: architecture/04-database.md]

### Frontend Architecture Requirements
- **Framework**: Next.js App Router with dynamic routing for materials [Source: architecture/01-frontend.md]
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui components for material viewer interface [Source: architecture/01-frontend.md]
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS for responsive material reading experience [Source: architecture/01-frontend.md]
- **PWA Features**: Offline capability for material access [Source: prd/04-4-non-functional-requirements-nfrs.md]

### API Implementation Requirements
- **Server Actions**: Next.js Server Actions for material fetching and serving [Source: architecture/02-backend-logic.md]
- **Validation**: Zod for material data validation [Source: architecture/02-backend-logic.md]
- **Authorization**: Student enrollment verification for material access

### Data Models Required
```typescript
// New Material model
Material {
  id, title, type, content, courseId, uploadDate, size, visibility, createdAt, updatedAt
}

// Material type enum
MaterialType {
  PDF, LINK, MARKDOWN
}

// Extend Course model relationship
Course {
  id, title, materials: Material[]
}
```

### File Locations (Building on Stories 2.1)
- Material components: `src/components/student/MaterialViewer.tsx`, `src/components/student/MaterialList.tsx`
- Materials pages: `src/app/dashboard/student/courses/[id]/materials/page.tsx`
- Material detail: `src/app/dashboard/student/courses/[id]/materials/[materialId]/page.tsx`

- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing or corrupted materials
- **Accessibility**: Proper heading structure and screen reader support

### Integration Points
- **Course System**: Leverages Course model and routing from Story 2.1
- **Authentication**: Uses Epic 1 student authentication and role verification
- **Dashboard**: Extends student dashboard with material access
- **Future Stories**: Foundation for assignment materials and submission attachments

### Business Rules
- **Enrollment Required**: Only enrolled students can access course materials
- **Material Visibility**: Respect instructor-set material visibility rules
- **Content Types**: Support PDF, markdown, and link materials as specified
- **Upload Source**: Materials uploaded by lecturers (future Epic 3 integration)

### Testing Requirements
- **Access Control Tests**: Verify enrollment-based material access
- **Material Type Tests**: PDF viewing, markdown rendering, link handling
- **Performance Tests**: Large file loading and caching behavior
- **Offline Tests**: PWA offline material access functionality
- **Security Tests**: Authorization and content sanitization
- **Responsive Tests**: Material viewing across different devices
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end material access workflow

### Project Structure Notes
Building on previous stories:
- Course detail pages exist from Story 2.1
- Student authentication and dashboard from Epic 1
- Need to add Material model to database schema
- Need to create material viewing and navigation components
- Need to implement secure file serving capabilities
